            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a software engineer located in the Salt Lake Metropolitan area. I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. It was here where I realized my passion for the puzzle of writing code. My previous career in hospitality coupled with my new passion for writing code makes I believe can make me an asset to any development team.</p>
            <p>I have a Bachelors Degree in Economics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, 4+ years of hospitality experience and a Certificate of Completion from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course</p>
            <p>I am an outdoor enthusiast with an insatiable appetite for adventure. Whether it be snowboarding, mountain biking, climbing or fishing I cant get enough of the outdoors!</p>
